### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2:

    This is my most favorite lab because this is the first time I have learned how to create a complex game such as Blackjack. In this lab, I have used a lot of computer science skills, such as problem-solving and using logical conditions. I like how the lab was structured to build a detailed blackjack game and connect all the parts to make it a complete game. I learned how to check for different card types and calculate the scores of every card. The hardest part of the lab was handling the Ace's dual value. But I figure it out by using conditions to check the total score and adjusting the Ace's value accordingly.

* Lab 7, Part 1:

    This is my second favorite lab because it taught me how street parking regulation was made by using conditional logic and programming to solve real-world problems. My favorite part of this lab was it organized separate functions for each street, which made the code reusable. The most challenging part was managing complex rules for parking times and days. However, I solved it by breaking each regulation into minor conditions and testing each function. This great lab helps me practice logical thinking and work with multiple constraints.

* Lab 9, Part 1:

    This is my third favorite lab because it teaches me how to process text files, compare lists of words, and handle input validation. These skills are crucial for my programming journey and for completing this spelling lab. The part I like about this lab is seeing how the program could identify spelling errors, making it practical. The lab's most challenging part was ensuring the comparison logic for detecting misspelled words worked correctly. Together, my lab partner and I can finally solve it by thoroughly testing it with various documents and dictionary files. This lab helped me improve my debugging skills and programming with text files.
